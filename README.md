credit score classification: Unveiling the patterns through machine learning model
<br>
Credit score classification data is a secondary data collected from Kaggle.com. This
data contains 100000 rows and 28 columns. Credit score classification is the process
of predicting or categorizing individuals into different credit score groups based on
various factors. Main aims to help lenders and financial institutions make informed
decisions about granting loans, credit cards, mortgages, or other forms of credit.

    In this Credit score classification:Unveiling patterns through machine learning 
project,main goal was to classifies credit scores based on various factors. To achieve this,
undertook a exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. The
EDA phase allowed us to identify missing values and potential outliers, enabling
us to prepare a clean and reliable dataset for analysis. Various statistical methods
used to determine the key factors influencing credit scores. From all this get to know
that the main facotr like credit history age credit mix influencing the credit score.
Along with other factor collectively effects the credit score. Further for the credit
score classification, explored different machine learning models, including logistic
regression, K nearest neighbours, Backpropagation, and Random Forest. Random
Forest model emerged as the top-performing algorithm compared to other model.
